## For loops and apply() workshop
This R script was created for the USU Ecology Center Workshop on for loops and the apply() family of functions. The script is typically emailed to workshop participants before the workshop. Participants follow along in the script and complete the exercises to practice building loops and selecting and running the apply() function.

## Topics
* Writing for-loops
* Writing custom functions
* The pros and cons of for loops vs the apply family of functions
* Combining iteration and custom functions for common data processing tasks
