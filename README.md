# For-loops_and_Functions_Workshop
These are the materials for the USU Ecology Center Workshop on for-loops and functions. This is the instructor key for the workshop, but it is best taught as a live coding session, with active participation from the workshop participants.

Covers topics including: iteration in R, for-loops, while loops, nested for-loops, lapply, sapply, custom functions, splitting and joining dataframes

Inspired by materials from Brian Smith, PhD Candidate at Utah State University
